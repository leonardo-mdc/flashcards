# Reimplementation Checklist

## Legend
- ✅ present & verified
- 🟡 present but incomplete
- ⬜ not yet implemented
- ❌ needs fix

---

## Infrastructure (our work)

- [x] ✅ `defective-main` branch created at `9247dcf` preserving fork state
- [x] ✅ `main` reset to `backup-before-makeover` (`586013d`)
- [x] ✅ Auto-deploy via GitHub Actions → FTP → InfinityFree
- [x] ✅ `reimplementation-plan.txt` cataloging all 72 commits
- [x] ✅ `healthcheck.php` for debugging
- [x] ✅ Deploy workflow preserves `config.php` (backup/restore + exclude)

## Our Phase 1 — Security & Data Integrity

- [x] ✅ XSS: `escapeHtml` escapes `"` and `'` in app.js + admin.js
- [x] ✅ Session fixation: `session_regenerate_id(true)` on login/register
- [x] ✅ Null-pointer guard: `record_review.php` exits if user not found
- [x] ✅ `User::ensureTable()` on all write methods
- [x] ✅ CSV export: missing columns (`image_url`, `description`, `audio_url`, `prompt`, `transcript`)
- [x] ✅ CSV export: header row written
- [x] ✅ Cache busting: `assetVersion()` via `filemtime()`
- [x] ✅ Card flip toggle: click again flips back to front
- [x] 🟡 `due_only` filter — parsed as boolean, **now also applied to card results** (was just fixed)
- [x] ✅ Clickable "due for review" button
- [x] ✅ `formatBreaks`: `\br` → `<br>` (PHP + JS)
